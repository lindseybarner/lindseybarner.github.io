I am a microscope builder and hardware developer with expertise in image processing and deep learning. I am seeking to work on cutting-edge research that will advance human health and patient care.

<br><br>

For my Ph.D. thesis, I developed the first multi-resolution open-top light-sheet microscope [1], enabled by
novel optics (patent pending) [2,3]. We have demonstrated 
the potential for this device to improve breast cancer staging accuracy and patient management after surgery [4]. 
The final chapter of my thesis focused on developing artificial intelligence approaches to assist pathologists 
with diagnosing esophageal cancer and dysplasia using 3D pathology [5]. My latest conference poster may be viewed <a href= "https://lindseybarner.github.io/docs/Barner_SPIE_poster.pdf">here.</a>

<br><br>
More recently, my latest research at Nanostring Technologies, Inc. involved developing a light sheet microscopy system for imaging RNA 
assays and protein analytes in 3D <span class="emphasized">in situ</span> .
