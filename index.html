I am a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington, 
conducting research with Dr. Jonathan Liu in the Molecular Biophotonics Laboratory. 
I am working to develop a novel 3D pathology imaging method to improve cancer diagnosis and patient care.

<br>

For my Ph.D. thesis, I have developed the first multi-resolution open-top light-sheet microscope [1] 
as well as the optics to enable this new technology (patent pending) [2,3]. We are working to demonstrate 
the potential for this device to improve breast cancer staging accuracy and patient management after surgery [4]. 
The final chapter of my thesis focuses on developing artificial intelligence approaches to assist pathologists 
with diagnosing esophageal cancer and dysplasia using 3D pathology. View my latest conference poster here.

My interests include developing novel imaging devices and image processing techniques to <b>improve human health and patient care.</b>
